All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

- Headings: h1 - h6 (decreasing order)
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3</h3>

- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag

- HTML links are defined with the <a> tag
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
Places the link in "This is a link"

- HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">


- HTML buttons are defined with the <button> tag:

   1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

- HTML Lists
HTML lists are defined with the <ul> (unordered/bullet list) or the <ol> (ordered/numbered list) tag, followed by <li> tags (list items):
Example
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>


- <br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break):
Example
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

- Add this after the !DOCTYPE for screenreaders
<html lang="en-US">


- <pre> is like <p> but more closely matches the format of the text.

- <tagname style="property:value;">
