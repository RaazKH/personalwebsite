## Getting Started

Before we can design a website we need to have a platform to run our script. This allows us to iteratively test and debug the website as it is being built.

>sudo apt-get update
>sudo apt-get install apache2

Then go into a webrowser and type "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
You should be able to see your website!

### Customizing the website
Now we need to navigate to the folder where the website is located
>cd var/www$
>ls
You should see a website now

###### Stop apache
>sudo /ect/init.d/apache2 stop

###### Restart apache
>sudo /ect/init.d/apache2 restart
